This is the HPkit package; it contains three simple CLI linux tools 
optimised to work with HP GPIB iterface.

**************************************
| DESCRIPTION                        |
--------------------------------------

The tools are:
 1. hplot
 2. hplisten
 3. hptalk
 4. hprologix

1. hplot
--------------------------------------
hplot is a tool used to dump or receive plot data from an instrument
using a serial GPIB adapter (e.g. the Prologix adapter) and emulating an
HP plotter.

You can set the device using the -d|--device option.

You can set the adapter you're using with -a|--adapter option. Currently
hplot supports only the prologix GPIB-USB adapter (currently GPIB-USB
controller 6.0) see http://www.prologix.biz

You can set the address to communicate with the instrument by using -r|--address
option.

You may save data to a file, using -o|--output or dump it to stdout.

You can use this tool within hp2xx, a GNU HPGL converter, with option -q, which
tells hp2xx to read data from hplot's stdout, for example:

 ./hplot -d /dev/ttyUSB0 | hp2xx -q

This command opens a window showing processed data. It should show an image
similar to the instrument's display.

The program stops reading the serial, when not receiving characters, after a 
timeout which can be set using the option -t|--timeout.

2. hplisten
--------------------------------------
hplisten is a reduced version of hplot, which doesn't emulate plotter and only 
dumps or saves received data to a file.

It has the same options as hplot.

3. hptalk
--------------------------------------
hptalk is a tool to send a command to the instrument and read the answer

You can tell hptalk not to read the answer sent by the instument if you need
it with -n|-no-answer option. BE CAREFUL, you can't use hplisten to read later 
the instrument's answer, because it uses a different technique. You have to use 
hptalk with the ADAPTER's command for reading (e.g "++read"), if you use
hplisten it will produce no output.

For example, with prologix adapter you would use:

$ hptalk -n FRS?         # It sends the FRS? command but doesn't read the answer
$ hptalk ++read          # NOW it reads the answer
+1.000000E+05
$

It has the same options as hplot;

4. hprologix
--------------------------------------
hprologix is a tool used to configure manually the Prologix adapter (NOTE that
normally the configuration is done by the single programs) and to send special
signals, for example RST (reset) or CLR (clear).

when you configure the adapter with hprologix, you may want to use the option 
"-a|--adapter none" which tells the program NOT to configure the adapter 
properly, to keep using your settings.

To get current configuration, simply call hprologix with option -g|--get-config.

To change the GPIB address, you use the option -r|--address, separating PAD 
(Primary ADdress) and SAD (Secondary ADdress) with a comma (NOTE that SAD isn't
compulsory).

To enable the autoreading feature after sending a command, use the option
-a|--autoread followed by 1 if you want to enable it, 0 if not.

With hprologix you can also send to the adapter the following signals:
 - IFC
 - CLR
 - LOC
 - SRQ
 - SPOLL

You can send them with option -n|--signal followed by the signal name (NOTE that
you can send only one signal once)

For more information about the previous signals see the Prologix Adapter User
Manual, which you can find at http://www.prologix.biz
